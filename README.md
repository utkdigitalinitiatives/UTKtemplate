# UT HTML Templates - Libraries Version

Notes on organization and usage 

Except for this readme (The UT original has been renamed README-UT.md) the files here are exactly the same as those in the HTML Web Templates download from  http://brandassets.utk.edu

Any Libraries additions to the original download are in directories with the addition - utlibraries (Ex. images-utlibraries) or use a .php extension (The original HTML files use a .html extension. )
